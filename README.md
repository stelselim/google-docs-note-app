# üìù Save Notes to Google Docs with Images

This project is a simple Go-based server that lets you save rich notes ‚Äî including text, tags, and images ‚Äî directly to a Google Docs document using the Google Drive and Docs APIs.

It‚Äôs designed to demonstrate OAuth 2.0 integration, working with multipart form uploads, and structured note-saving into a single shared document.

<br>

## Features

- [X] Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- [X] Upload images to Google Drive
- [X] Save notes (title, tags, text, and images) to a **single Google Docs file**
- [X] Insert each new note at the top of the document
- [X] Two REST API endpoints:
  - `POST /note`: Add a new note with optional images
  - `GET /notes`: Retrieve all notes in structured JSON format
- [X] Lightweight: No external deployment required ‚Äî runs locally

<br>

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate and authorize access to Google Docs & Drive APIs.
2. **Image Upload**: Uploaded images are saved to Google Drive, and their URLs are retrieved.
3. **Note Formatting**: A note containing the title, tags, timestamp, and content (with inline images) is created.
4. **Google Docs Update**: The formatted note is inserted at the beginning of a predefined Google Doc (ID is set via an environment variable).

<br>

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variable before running the app:

```bash
GOOGLE_DOCS_ID=your_google_docs_id_here
```

<br>

## Running Locally

1.	Clone the repo
2.	Set up your Google Cloud project (enable Drive & Docs APIs)
3.  Authenticate with Google (locally). In this project, you can use `gcloud auth application-default login` to set up Application Default Credentials.
4.	Set GOOGLE_DOCS_ID in your environment
5.	Run the server:

```bash
go run main.go
```
